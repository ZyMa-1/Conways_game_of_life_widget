Improve DOM_XML to be more dynamic (yes done)
Qt linguist stuff (yea)
Notify properties methods (yea)
Remove _game_properties_to_widgets_values function, replace it with PropertiesManager (yes done)

Good old settings manager (yes)
Make separate color handler widget to separate its inner logic (button click, color dialog itself and stuff,
    and outside logic (maybe idk)) (nah, no need)
Auto convert widget to properties func in PropertiesManager. (y)
I am thinking of some config file which literally would define all handlers stuff and it is even better to do
    that for settings (good thing, but hard to create customizable thing)

Why StringList property doesnt work?? (why)
Status bar hints (lazy)
Try to write Jekyll documentation (lazy)
QML (no, i have so much to do)
