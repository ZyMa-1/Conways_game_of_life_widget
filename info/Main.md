# Main:
I have developed a convenient script that automates the conversion process for UI files, enabling the transformation of ".ui" files to ".py" files effortlessly. 
Additionally, it provides the capability to convert ".qrc" files to ".py", facilitating resource file conversion. Moreover, the script is capable of generating ".qm" files from ".ts" files, streamlining the localization process.

The file location is: [scripts/full_convert.py](../scripts/full_convert.py)
