Custom widget made using PySide version 6 and Python 3.10. Latest version of the widget was created using Graphics/View Qt framework.
Was integratable with Qt Designer, but the intentions changed.  
  
The project includes a ConfigManager that allows to save properties of the game widget into a JSON file and subsequently load them back into a widget.  
  
The project also includes a PropertiesManager that facilitates communication between widgets and game widget properties, ensuring that any changes made to one are appropriately reflected in the other.

Goal of the project was to learn how to build scalable and manageble application.
